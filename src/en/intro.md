## Some projects that I have written

### Fewu

Discontinued since I moved to Vuepress.

[![Fewu](//img.shields.io/badge/Fewu-3.3-3273d2)](//github.com/0xarch/fewu)

[Fewu](//github.com/0xarch/fewu) is a SSG (Static site generator) like Hexo. But it's tiny.
Fewu is completely open-source!

Fewu can be downloaded via `npm` with the package name `fewu-cli` and executable file `fewu`.

Also some themes developed for Fewu:
* `Arch`, Deprecated. Icarus-like
* `Wacal`ï¼ŒDeprecated. GNOME-like
* `simplus`, Deprecated. KDE-like
* `Neo`, Fuwari-like. This theme has the best compatibility with the latest fewu release.
